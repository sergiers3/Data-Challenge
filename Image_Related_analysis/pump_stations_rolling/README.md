We use rolling: for each data point, the average of previous N points is calculated, in order to smooth the chart. Furthermore, it would show patterns in the data, for example: if we roll by 24 hours, we can find the daily trend.

Staion 4120 and 4170 are selected since they have siginificantly high volume compare to others.

The rolling values are: 4h, 6h, 12h and 24h. The chart from each of these values are plotted along with the original data to make a comparision. The folder also contains a chart contains all of these value and unrolled data.
